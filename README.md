# SWAPI React Autocomplete Search

I have made SWAPI Search in a very simpler way using [react-bootstrap-typeahead](https://github.com/ericgio/react-bootstrap-typeahead) a react-based typeahead component. This app is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). loading data via [SWAPI](https://swapi.co).

TypeHead Js [Typeahead.js](http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/)  is twitter driven which is fast and a fully featured autocomplete library.
